# Chapter 1: The Inheritance

The lighthouse stood like a sentinel against the gray New England sky, its red and white stripes faded by decades of salt air and neglect. Margaret Sullivan—Maggie to the few who knew her well enough—paused at the base of the winding gravel path, her sensible shoes crunching on the loose stones as a gust of wind tugged at her silver bob. She adjusted her reading glasses on their chain and unfolded the letter again, though she had read it so many times the creases were beginning to tear.

*...bequeath to my distant cousin, Margaret Sullivan, the entirety of the Harbor Point Lighthouse property, including the keeper's house and all surrounding lands as described in the attached deed...*

The words hadn't changed since yesterday, or the day before. Maggie carefully refolded the letter along its well-worn creases and tucked it into the pocket of her cardigan. She glanced at her watch—still thirty minutes before the real estate agent was due to arrive. Good. She preferred to make her first assessment alone.

At sixty-eight, with forty years as a reference librarian behind her, Maggie had developed a methodical approach to new situations. Observe first. Catalog the details. Draw conclusions only after gathering sufficient data. The lighthouse deserved the same careful consideration, even if she would likely end up selling it.

The path steepened as she approached, and her left knee protested with a familiar twinge. Maggie paused, one hand resting lightly on the weathered wooden fence that lined the walkway. From this vantage point, she could take in the full view of her unexpected inheritance.

The lighthouse tower itself appeared structurally sound, despite the peeling paint. The attached keeper's house was another matter entirely—windows boarded over, shingles missing from the roof, the once-white trim now a patchwork of gray and bare wood. The small outbuildings nearby were in similar states of disrepair.

"Quite the retirement project," Maggie murmured, her lips twisting into a wry smile. Three years into a retirement she hadn't wanted, she'd settled into a quiet routine of volunteer work at the local library and occasional lectures at the community college. Nothing that truly engaged her mind or filled the void left by her career. Nothing that mattered.

She straightened her shoulders and continued up the path, noting how the sea grasses had reclaimed portions of what had once been a garden. Rugosa roses, gone wild and tangled, still clung to a trellis that was slowly collapsing under their weight. The scent of salt and impending rain hung in the air, and somewhere in the distance, a foghorn sounded—one of the modern automated beacons that had made lighthouses like this one obsolete.

At the door to the keeper's house, Maggie retrieved an ancient-looking key from her purse. The lawyer had sent it along with the deed and a folder of documents she had yet to fully explore. The key turned with surprising ease, though the door itself required a firm push to open, its bottom edge scraping against the wooden floor.

The musty scent of long-closed rooms greeted her, along with the faint smell of old wood and something else—beeswax polish, perhaps, from some long-ago caretaker's efforts. Dust motes danced in the shafts of light that penetrated through cracks in the boarded windows. Maggie stood in the entryway, allowing her eyes to adjust to the dimness.

The main room was larger than she had expected, with a stone fireplace dominating one wall. Sheets draped what she assumed was furniture, ghostly shapes in the half-light. A staircase with an elegant banister curved up to the second floor, and a narrow hallway led toward what would be the back of the house.

Maggie's footsteps echoed slightly as she moved further into the room. She ran her fingers along the banister, leaving trails in the dust. Despite the years of neglect, the craftsmanship was evident—solid oak, hand-carved spindles, the kind of quality rarely seen in modern construction.

"Hello," she called, her voice sounding smaller than intended in the empty space. She cleared her throat and tried again. "I'm Maggie Sullivan."

Only the distant cry of gulls answered her.

With the same methodical approach she had used when organizing library collections, Maggie began a systematic exploration of the ground floor. She pulled sheets from furniture to reveal solid, if outdated, pieces: a sofa with surprisingly good bones, a dining table with six chairs, sideboards and cabinets that spoke of craftsmanship rarely seen in modern furniture. Everything was coated in dust, but nothing appeared damaged beyond repair.

The kitchen was a time capsule from the 1970s, the last time the lighthouse had been regularly occupied. Avocado-colored appliances stood like abandoned sentries. Maggie opened cupboards to find dishes still stacked neatly, waiting for a meal that never came.

She ran a finger along a countertop and examined the thick dust that came away on her skin. The layer was undisturbed, no swirls or patterns that would indicate recent activity. Whoever had left this place had done so abruptly, and no one had properly returned since.

The narrow hallway led to a small study, lined with built-in bookshelves that stood mostly empty. A few nautical reference books remained, along with logbooks and technical manuals for lighthouse operation. A heavy desk sat beneath a window that, when unboarded, would offer a view of the harbor.

Maggie approached the desk, drawn by the familiar comfort of a workspace dedicated to knowledge and record-keeping. Its surface was bare except for a brass lamp and an old blotter. On impulse, she pulled open the center drawer.

Empty, save for a few pencil stubs and paperclips.

She tried the side drawers—more of the same, the detritus of administrative work abandoned decades ago. But the bottom right drawer stuck slightly. Maggie tugged with more force, and it opened with a reluctant groan.

Inside lay a single envelope, yellowed with age, the paper of a quality rarely seen in modern stationery. It was unsealed, the flap simply tucked in. No name or address marked its exterior.

Maggie's pulse quickened as she lifted the envelope. Her fingers, which had handled thousands of rare documents throughout her career, recognized the weight and texture of high-quality cotton paper, likely from the 1950s based on its composition. She carefully opened the flap and removed a single sheet of paper, covered in a flowing, feminine handwriting executed in faded blue ink.

*May 12, 1952*

*I've begun this record against my better judgment, but I can no longer bear the solitary weight of what I know. Father's condition worsens daily, and with it, my isolation here grows more complete. The lighthouse keeps its secrets, as do I, but for how much longer?*

*Today I noticed another discrepancy in the logbook—the third this month. The official record shows clear weather on the night of April 18, but I know with absolute certainty that we had dense fog from dusk until well past midnight. I maintained the foghorn myself, spelling Father who could barely rise from his bed. Yet the log, in handwriting not my own nor Father's, reports "clear visibility, standard operation."*

*Someone is altering our records, but to what purpose? The harbormaster visited yesterday, asking peculiar questions about shipping movements and visibility records for specific dates. His manner was cordial as always, but something in his eyes made me uneasy. I provided only the information in the official logs, though I know them to be false in parts.*

*The lighthouse has stood guardian to this harbor for nearly a century, its light a promise of safe passage and honest warning of danger. What does it mean when the record of that guardianship is compromised? And why do I feel that asking these questions puts me in danger?*

*I will hide this letter where it might someday be found by someone who can make sense of these events, should anything happen to me. The lighthouse deserves a keeper who honors truth as much as safety.*

*—E.W.*

Maggie read the letter twice, her breathing shallow, her librarian's mind already cataloging the questions it raised. Who was E.W.? What were these discrepancies, and why would someone falsify lighthouse records? What danger did the writer perceive?

She held the letter to the dim light filtering through the boarded window. The paper showed no watermarks or identifying features beyond its quality. The handwriting was educated, confident—someone accustomed to writing. The ink had faded but remained legible, suggesting it had been protected from direct sunlight all these years.

A door slammed somewhere outside, startling Maggie from her examination. She glanced at her watch—the real estate agent was early. Carefully, she returned the letter to its envelope and slipped it into her purse. Whatever secrets this lighthouse held, they would require proper investigation, not a rushed assessment before a sales pitch.

As she made her way back to the front door, Maggie found herself looking at the lighthouse with new eyes. What had seemed like an unwelcome burden—an inheritance from a cousin she'd never met, a property she had no use for—now felt like something else entirely. A mystery. A connection to the past. A project worthy of her skills.

The real estate agent was climbing out of her car, a portfolio tucked under one arm, a bright smile already in place. Maggie squared her shoulders and felt a familiar sensation she hadn't experienced in the three years since her forced retirement: the quiet excitement of purpose.

The lighthouse might be a neglected relic of the past, but its secrets were very much alive. And Maggie Sullivan had always been good at uncovering secrets.
