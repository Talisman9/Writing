# Chapter 1: The Inheritance

The lighthouse stood like a sentinel against the gray New England sky, its red and white stripes faded by decades of salt air and neglect. Margaret Sullivan—Maggie to the few who knew her well enough—stood at the base of the winding gravel path, her sensible shoes crunching on the loose stones as a gust of wind tugged at her silver bob. She adjusted her reading glasses on their chain and consulted the letter in her hand one more time, though she had memorized its contents days ago.

*...bequeath to my distant cousin, Margaret Sullivan, the entirety of the Harbor Point Lighthouse property, including the keeper's house and all surrounding lands as described in the attached deed...*

Maggie folded the letter carefully along its well-worn creases and tucked it into the pocket of her cardigan. At sixty-eight, she had not expected to inherit anything, let alone a decommissioned lighthouse on a rocky promontory in a town she'd never visited. Three years into a retirement she hadn't wanted, the inheritance felt less like a gift and more like a cosmic joke.

"Well," she said aloud to the empty air, "at least it's a change of scenery."

The real estate agent had offered to meet her here, but Maggie had declined. After forty years as a librarian, she preferred to assess situations without commentary or sales pitches. The lighthouse and its keeper's house deserved her undivided attention—even if she ended up selling the property, as seemed most practical.

The path steepened as she approached, and Maggie felt the familiar twinge in her left knee. She paused, leaning slightly on the weathered wooden fence that lined the walkway, and took in the full view of her unexpected inheritance.

The lighthouse tower itself appeared structurally sound, despite the peeling paint. The attached keeper's house was another matter entirely—windows boarded over, shingles missing from the roof, the once-white trim now a patchwork of gray and bare wood. The small outbuildings nearby were in similar states of disrepair. The entire property had the forlorn look of something once cherished, then abandoned.

"Just like me," Maggie murmured with a wry smile, then immediately chided herself for the self-pity.

She continued up the path, noting how the sea grasses had reclaimed portions of what had once been a garden. Rugosa roses, gone wild and tangled, still clung to a trellis that was slowly collapsing under their weight. The scent of salt and impending rain hung in the air, and somewhere in the distance, a foghorn sounded—one of the modern automated beacons that had made lighthouses like this one obsolete.

At the door to the keeper's house, Maggie retrieved an ancient-looking key from her purse. The lawyer had sent it along with the deed and a folder of documents she had yet to fully explore. The key turned with surprising ease, though the door itself required a firm push to open, its bottom edge scraping against the wooden floor.

The musty scent of long-closed rooms greeted her, along with the faint smell of old wood and something else—beeswax polish, perhaps, from some long-ago caretaker's efforts. Dust motes danced in the shafts of light that penetrated through cracks in the boarded windows. Maggie stood in the entryway, allowing her eyes to adjust to the dimness.

The main room was larger than she had expected, with a stone fireplace dominating one wall. Sheets draped what she assumed was furniture, ghostly shapes in the half-light. A staircase with an elegant banister curved up to the second floor, and a narrow hallway led toward what would be the back of the house.

"Hello," she called, feeling slightly foolish but unable to shake the sense that she was intruding. Her voice echoed slightly in the empty space. "I'm Maggie Sullivan. I suppose I'm your new owner."

Only the distant cry of gulls answered her.

With methodical precision—the same approach she had used when organizing library collections—Maggie began a systematic exploration of the ground floor. She pulled sheets from furniture to reveal solid, if outdated, pieces: a sofa with surprisingly good bones, a dining table with six chairs, sideboards and cabinets that spoke of craftsmanship rarely seen in modern furniture. Everything was coated in dust, but nothing appeared damaged beyond repair.

The kitchen was a time capsule from the 1970s, the last time the lighthouse had been regularly occupied. Avocado-colored appliances stood like abandoned sentries. Maggie opened cupboards to find dishes still stacked neatly, waiting for a meal that never came.

"Someone left in a hurry," she observed, running a finger along a countertop and examining the thick dust that came away on her skin.

The narrow hallway led to a small study, lined with built-in bookshelves that stood mostly empty. A few nautical reference books remained, along with logbooks and technical manuals for lighthouse operation. A heavy desk sat beneath a window that, when unboarded, would offer a view of the harbor.

Maggie approached the desk, drawn by the familiar comfort of a workspace dedicated to knowledge and record-keeping. Its surface was bare except for a brass lamp and an old blotter. On impulse, she pulled open the center drawer.

Empty, save for a few pencil stubs and paperclips.

She tried the side drawers—more of the same, the detritus of administrative work abandoned decades ago. But the bottom right drawer stuck slightly. Maggie tugged with more force, and it opened with a reluctant groan.

Inside lay a single envelope, yellowed with age, the paper of a quality rarely seen in modern stationery. It was unsealed, the flap simply tucked in. No name or address marked its exterior.

With the careful hands of someone who had spent a career handling delicate documents, Maggie lifted the envelope and opened it. Inside was a single sheet of paper, covered in a flowing, feminine handwriting executed in faded blue ink.

*May 12, 1952*

*I've begun this record against my better judgment, but I can no longer bear the solitary weight of what I know. Father's condition worsens daily, and with it, my isolation here grows more complete. The lighthouse keeps its secrets, as do I, but for how much longer?*

*Today I noticed another discrepancy in the logbook—the third this month. The official record shows clear weather on the night of April 18, but I know with absolute certainty that we had dense fog from dusk until well past midnight. I maintained the foghorn myself, spelling Father who could barely rise from his bed. Yet the log, in handwriting not my own nor Father's, reports "clear visibility, standard operation."*

*Someone is altering our records, but to what purpose? The harbormaster visited yesterday, asking peculiar questions about shipping movements and visibility records for specific dates. His manner was cordial as always, but something in his eyes made me uneasy. I provided only the information in the official logs, though I know them to be false in parts.*

*The lighthouse has stood guardian to this harbor for nearly a century, its light a promise of safe passage and honest warning of danger. What does it mean when the record of that guardianship is compromised? And why do I feel that asking these questions puts me in danger?*

*I will hide this letter where it might someday be found by someone who can make sense of these events, should anything happen to me. The lighthouse deserves a keeper who honors truth as much as safety.*

*—E.W.*

Maggie read the letter twice, then carefully returned it to its envelope. Her heart beat a little faster, the familiar thrill of historical discovery warming her veins. Here was something unexpected—a mystery, a voice from the past, a puzzle that appealed to her librarian's soul.

She looked around the study with new eyes. This room had belonged to someone—this E.W.—who had felt threatened, who had hidden a letter for future discovery. And now, seventy-three years later, Maggie had found it.

"Well," she said to the empty room, her voice steadier than she felt, "it seems I have a research project."

Outside, the wind picked up, whistling around the lighthouse tower. The first drops of rain began to patter against the boarded windows. Maggie carefully placed the letter in her purse and continued her exploration with renewed purpose, her mind already cataloging questions and possible avenues of investigation.

The lighthouse, which had seemed like an unwelcome burden just hours before, now felt like something else entirely—a repository of secrets, a connection to the past, and perhaps, a new beginning.

As she climbed the curved staircase to the second floor, Maggie Sullivan felt something she hadn't experienced in the three years since her forced retirement: the quiet excitement of purpose.
