# Drafting Strategy for "The Forgotten Letters"

## Productivity Metrics and Targets

### Daily Writing Goals
- **Word Count Target**: 2,000 words per day (approximately one chapter)
- **Time Allocation**: 4 hours of focused writing time, divided into 50-minute sessions with 10-minute breaks
- **Scene Completion**: Aim to complete at least one full scene per writing session
- **Weekly Goal**: Complete 5 chapters per week (10,000 words)

### Progress Tracking
- **Completion Percentage**: Track by dividing completed words by total target (100,000 characters/20,000 words)
- **Chapter Completion**: Mark chapters as Draft 1, Draft 2, or Final Draft
- **Scene Effectiveness**: Rate each scene on a scale of 1-5 for emotional impact, plot advancement, and character development
- **Consistency Metrics**: Track daily word count to identify productivity patterns

### Quality Indicators
- **Sensory Detail Density**: Aim for at least 3 distinct sensory details per scene
- **Dialogue-to-Narrative Ratio**: Maintain approximately 40% dialogue to 60% narrative for this cozy mystery genre
- **Character Viewpoint Consistency**: Ensure POV remains consistent within each chapter
- **Historical Accuracy**: Verify period details for 1950s sections against research materials

## Section Prioritization Approach

### Critical Path Sections
1. **Opening Chapter**: Establish Maggie's character and the lighthouse B&B setting
2. **First Letter Discovery**: The inciting incident that launches the mystery
3. **Historical Character Introduction**: First substantial letter revealing Eleanor's voice and 1950s setting
4. **Midpoint Revelation**: Key historical information that shifts the investigation
5. **Climactic Confrontation**: Scene with descendant of historical antagonist
6. **Resolution**: Tying together historical and present-day narratives

### Writing Sequence Strategy
- Begin with the **Opening Chapter** to establish voice and tone
- Write the **First Letter Discovery** to solidify the central mystery
- Alternate between present-day and historical chapters to maintain dual timeline structure
- Draft key emotional scenes early to establish character arcs
- Save transitional scenes for later drafting when narrative flow is clearer

### Timeline Management
- Allocate 2 weeks for initial drafting (10 chapters per week)
- Reserve additional week for challenging sections and revisions
- Create buffer days for unexpected delays or difficult passages

## Challenging Section Strategy

### Identified Challenging Elements
- **Historical Letter Voice**: Creating authentic 1950s voice distinct from present-day narrative
- **Mystery Clue Distribution**: Balancing information revelation without being too obvious or obscure
- **Emotional Climax**: Crafting impactful confrontation scene with historical implications
- **Dual Timeline Integration**: Ensuring both timelines remain engaging and connected

### Approach for Difficult Sections
- **Research Immersion**: Spend additional time with reference materials before attempting historical sections
- **Scaffolding Method**: Create detailed outlines for complex scenes before drafting
- **Dialogue-First Approach**: For emotional scenes, draft dialogue exchanges first, then add narrative elements
- **Comparative Analysis**: Reference similar scenes in comparative titles for structural guidance
- **Time Blocking**: Allocate specific, uninterrupted time for challenging sections when energy is highest

### Contingency Planning
- If a section proves too difficult, skip temporarily and return after drafting connected scenes
- Create alternative approaches for each challenging section
- Maintain a "problems to solve" document for tracking difficult elements

## Consistency Maintenance Plan

### Character Consistency
- Create quick-reference character sheets with key traits, speech patterns, and motivations
- Review previous chapters featuring each character before writing new scenes
- Track character emotional states and knowledge across chapters
- Maintain a timeline of character appearances and interactions

### Setting Consistency
- Develop a "lighthouse map" detailing rooms and features for spatial consistency
- Create a seasonal and weather tracking document for the two-week present-day timeline
- Maintain a list of established sensory details for each location
- Review setting descriptions before adding new details

### Voice and Style Consistency
- Establish distinct markers for present-day vs. historical narrative sections
- Create style guide with sentence structure patterns, vocabulary preferences, and rhythm examples
- Review previous day's writing before beginning each new session
- Read dialogue aloud to ensure character voice consistency

## Momentum Preservation Techniques

### Session Management
- Begin each writing session by reviewing the previous day's work
- End each session by creating a brief outline for the next day's writing
- Use the Pomodoro Technique (50 minutes writing, 10 minutes break) to maintain focus
- Set clear, achievable daily goals to create sense of accomplishment

### Writer's Block Strategies
- Maintain a "scene seeds" document with ideas for future scenes
- Create a bank of sensory details for each major location to overcome descriptive blocks
- Develop character conversation starters for dialogue-heavy scenes
- When blocked, switch to a different scene or character perspective

### Motivation Techniques
- Track daily word count progress visually
- Celebrate milestone achievements (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Schedule regular "inspiration sessions" with comparative titles
- Create accountability through regular GitHub commits

## Feedback Integration Points

### Planned Feedback Stages
1. **Concept Validation**: After first three chapters (confirm voice, pacing, and premise)
2. **Midpoint Assessment**: At 50% completion (evaluate plot progression and character development)
3. **Climax Effectiveness**: After drafting the confrontation scene (assess emotional impact)
4. **Full Draft Review**: Upon completion of first draft (comprehensive evaluation)

### Feedback Focus Areas
- **Reader Engagement**: Assess how quickly readers connect with Maggie and the mystery
- **Mystery Effectiveness**: Evaluate if clues are appropriately paced and challenging
- **Emotional Resonance**: Determine if key scenes evoke intended emotional responses
- **Dual Timeline Balance**: Confirm both timelines maintain reader interest
- **Target Audience Alignment**: Verify appeal to intended 65+ demographic

### Feedback Implementation Process
1. Collect feedback in organized document
2. Categorize by type (plot, character, pacing, etc.)
3. Prioritize based on frequency and impact
4. Create specific revision plan for addressing feedback
5. Implement changes systematically

## Revision Trigger Identification

### Content Revision Triggers
- Inconsistencies in character behavior or motivation
- Plot holes or logical gaps in the mystery
- Pacing issues (too slow or rushed)
- Insufficient emotional impact in key scenes
- Imbalance between present-day and historical timelines
- Unclear connections between past and present events

### Stylistic Revision Triggers
- Repetitive sentence structures or word choices
- Inconsistent voice between chapters
- Dialogue that doesn't match character profiles
- Insufficient sensory detail in important settings
- Telling rather than showing emotional states
- Unclear transitions between scenes or timelines

### Process for Addressing Triggers
1. Flag issues during initial drafting with comments
2. Create a revision log documenting each issue
3. Group similar issues for efficient revision
4. Address structural issues before stylistic concerns
5. Verify fixes don't create new inconsistencies
