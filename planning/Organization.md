# Content Organization Strategy

## Outlining Methodology

For "The Forgotten Letters," a dual-timeline cozy mystery with historical romance elements, I'll employ a **parallel narrative structure** that alternates between present-day investigation and historical revelations through discovered letters. This approach serves our target audience (65+ readers at 6th grade reading level) by providing clear orientation while maintaining engagement through mystery elements.

### Primary Outlining Approach
The novel will use a **modified three-act structure** with parallel timelines:

#### Act 1: Discovery and Setup (Chapters 1-5)
- **Present Timeline**: Maggie inherits lighthouse, discovers first letter, meets key characters
- **Historical Timeline**: Eleanor's situation established through initial letters
- **Connection Points**: First hints of historical mystery that connects to present

#### Act 2: Investigation and Complications (Chapters 6-13)
- **Present Timeline**: Maggie's investigation deepens, opposition emerges, B&B renovation progresses
- **Historical Timeline**: Eleanor's discovery of discrepancies, relationship with Thomas, increasing danger
- **Connection Points**: Revelations about how past events shaped present community

#### Act 3: Climax and Resolution (Chapters 14-16 + Epilogue)
- **Present Timeline**: Confrontation with antagonist, truth revealed, community acknowledgment
- **Historical Timeline**: Eleanor's final actions and choices revealed
- **Connection Points**: Resolution that honors both timelines and provides closure

### Outlining Tools and Techniques
1. **Chapter Cards**: Each chapter outlined on digital card with:
   - Timeline indicator (Present/Historical/Both)
   - POV character
   - Key plot advancement
   - Emotional beat
   - Setting details
   - Timeline connection point

2. **Timeline Mapping**: Parallel visual timelines showing:
   - Present-day events (2-week span)
   - Historical events (1950s, several months)
   - Points where timelines intersect through discoveries

3. **Scene Clustering**: Related scenes grouped by:
   - Investigation thread
   - Relationship development
   - Character growth moment
   - Historical revelation

4. **Narrative Threads Tracking**: Color-coded tracking of:
   - Mystery investigation (primary plot)
   - Romance development (subplot)
   - B&B establishment (practical plot)
   - Historical injustice (backstory plot)

## Scene Sequencing Strategy
